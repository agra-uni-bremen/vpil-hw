# VPiL : Hardware-in-the-Loop with Virtual Prototypes and FPGAs

This repository contains the hardware description for the work "Towards Hardware-in-the-Loop for Virtual Prototypes and RTL with VPiL".

The [VPiL bus protocol can be found at in a co-existing repository](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/virtual-bus) for modularity, as the protocol is not bound to this specific hardware description or the [RISC-V VP](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/riscv-vp) in particular.

Details of the implementation are partially described in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00442).
